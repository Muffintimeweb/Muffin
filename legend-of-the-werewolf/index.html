          <p>The term waswolf, or lycanthrope (lykánthrôpos of the Greek lúkos, loup and ánthrôpos, human being), refers to a human being who has the faculty of transforming himself into a wolf, voluntarily or involuntarily. The metamorphosis usually occurs during the nights of full moon, forcing the lycanthropus to wander in its wolf form until the first rays of the sun.</p>
<p>In its modern version, the werewolf presents all the physical characteristics of the wolf: long hairs completely cover the body and it is suddenly provided with fantastic muscular power, long fangs and sharp claws. The werewolf screams to the moon like a wolf, and if he sometimes stands on two legs, like a man, it is not an absolute rule. When he changes his appearance, his sense of smell, hearing and night vision develop. He becomes agile, cunning, and shows incredible speed. The werewolf is a lonely and merciless killer. He always shows an implacable ferocity and massacres without distinction the animals and the men whom he crosses at random from his nocturnal outings in order to regain their flesh. Like the vampires,</p>

<p>There used to be as many different versions of the werewolf as legends. Its appearance varied according to the time and country, but it was often described as difficult to differentiate from an ordinary wolf.<br />
The werewolf was provided with a large mouth, a sparkling look and hooked teeth. He was sometimes portrayed as a huge wolf, others like a wolf-headed human, but it could also look like our modern version of the werewolf. Here is Simon Goulard&#8217;s description (1543-1628): &#8220;The werewolf is different from the wolf in that his coat is not outside, but between leather and flesh. It goes as fast as the wolf, which must not be found unbelievable, for it is the efforts of the evil demon that shape them as the wolves want. While walking, They leave on the earth the trace of wolves. Their eyes are frightful and sparkling like wolves, ravages and cruelty of wolves, choke dogs, cut their throats with teeth to young children, take a taste for human flesh like wolves, have skill and resolution Men to perform such acts. And when they run together, they are accustomed to depart from their hunt to each other. If they are drunk, they scream to call the others. &#8221; They are accustomed to depart from their hunt to each other. If they are drunk, they scream to call the others. &#8221; They are accustomed to depart from their hunt to each other. If they are drunk, they scream to call the others. &#8221;</p>
<p>Some testimonies said that the lycanthropists did not have a tail, but that they kept their eyes and a human voice. Thus, according to some Swedish tales, the werewolf could be distinguished from an ordinary wolf because it moved only on three legs. He stretched the fourth backwards to make it look like a tail.<br />
If their descriptions changed, there was one thing in common among all lycanthropists in medieval Europe: they seemed to have a clear preference for young children, and they devoured freshly buried corpses.<br />
The powers of the lycanthropes seemed to increase during the new moon and at the time of the solstices, but some Christian religious festivals seemed to reinforce them as much. So, In some texts, mention was made of transformations which had lasted up to twelve days after Christmas. In the twentieth century Gervais de Tilbury pointed out that in England it was common to see men change into wolves when the moon began a new cycle. In 1848, when the moon was red, one could witness epidemics of lycanthropy.</p>
<p>Olaus Magnus reported that in Prussia, Livonia and Lithuania, the inhabitants suffered throughout the year from the rapacity of the wolves who decimated their cattle, but as they were dispersed through a great number of woods, they were not Not as dangerous as the men who turned into wolves.<br />
For the feast of Christ&#8217;s Nativity, a multitude of men transformed into wolves gathered in certain places to spread their rage and incredible ferocity against human beings and domestic animals.<br />
People from these areas suffered much more from these wolves than from real wolves because when they spotted an isolated dwelling in the woods, they cruelly besieged it, striving to break its doors. When they arrived, They devoured all the human beings and all the animals that were inside. They also broke into the beer cellars, emptied the barrels of beer or mead and then piled empty casks one above the other in the middle of the cellar, thus showing their difference with the real wolves. Between Lithuania, Livonia and Courland stood the walls of an old castle in ruins. At this place thousands of wolves were gathering, trying to prove their agility in the jump. Those who were unable to cross the walls, as was often the case with the larger ones, were killed without hesitation by their captain. Emptied the casks of beer or mead, and then they piled the empty barrels one above the other in the middle of the cellar, showing their difference with the real wolves. Between Lithuania, Livonia and Courland stood the walls of an old castle in ruins. At this place thousands of wolves were gathering, trying to prove their agility in the jump. Those who were unable to cross the walls, as was often the case with the larger ones, were killed without hesitation by their captain. Emptied the casks of beer or mead, and then they piled the empty barrels one above the other in the middle of the cellar, showing their difference with the real wolves. Between Lithuania, Livonia and Courland stood the walls of an old castle in ruins. At this place thousands of wolves were gathering, trying to prove their agility in the jump. Those who were unable to cross the walls, as was often the case with the larger ones, were killed without hesitation by their captain. At this place thousands of wolves were gathering, trying to prove their agility in the jump. Those who were unable to cross the walls, as was often the case with the larger ones, were killed without hesitation by their captain. At this place thousands of wolves were gathering, trying to prove their agility in the jump. Those who were unable to cross the walls, as was often the case with the larger ones, were killed without hesitation by their captain.</p>
<p>The origins of the werewolf are old and uncertain. For many centuries the specialists have been confronting each other on the subject without being able to agree. Of course, many factors can explain the legends about the lycanthropes, but there is still a part of the unresolved mystery that makes the belief in the myth of the werewolf still strangely widespread. According to the legends and writings that have come down to us, there used to be many ways to become a werewolf. Lycanthropy may be due to the bite or scratches of a wolf or werewolf, satanic ritual, curse, absorption of human flesh, magic filter or pact with But it could also be acquired at birth,</p>

<p class="wp-caption-text">The Metamorphosis of Lycaon en Loup</p>

<p><span class="ContentBox" data-cd="Text">Lycanthropy could be the result of a divine punishment as we learn from the legend of King Lycaon, the first and oldest of the famous werewolves. In Greek mythology, Lycaon was king of Arcadia. He was known to be a cruel king who respected nothing and nobody and was known for his disdain for the gods. In order to test him, Zeus, accompanied by other gods, presented himself to him in the guise of a beggar.<br />
Lycaon, scenting the trap, invited the beggars to eat at his table. But, desiring to verify their divine nature, he caused his grandson, Arcas, to be killed and offered it to the gods as a meal.<br />
All the gods immediately perceived it, except Demeter, who mistakenly ate a shoulder. Unworthy, Zeus then thundered the king&#8217;s fifty sons and then changed Lycaon into a wolf. The young Arcas was resurrected and Zeus offered him the throne of his grandfather. When her shoulder was missing, she was replaced by a silver shoulder.<br />
Following this legend, cannibalism was closely associated with lycanthropy in ancient Greece, where it was also believed that devouring the raw flesh of an enraged wolf transformed into a lycanthropist.</span></p>
<p>On Mount Lykaion, the birthplace of Zeus, games were held every four years. They were accompanied by banquets in honor of the god, during which practices of cannibalism were common. The human flesh was divided between the different participants who were then changed into wolves for nine years. If they did not consume any human flesh during this period, they could then recover their original form.<br />
Quoting Agriopas, Pliny the Elder reported the story of the Demenet of Parrhasia, who, having tasted the entrails of a child, sacrificed at a sacrifice that the Arcadians had made to Jupiter, had been transformed into a wolf. At the end of ten years, he had returned to his human form and then went to the Games, where he had competed for the price of the pugilate. He had returned victorious from Olympia. In his writings Pliny the Elder also quoted Euanthes, a Greek writer who was not without reputation, who explained that according to the books of the Arcadians, a man from the family of a certain Anthus was chosen at random from among his own And that he was taken to a pond in Arcadia and then hung his clothes on an oak before crossing the pond, then he turned into a wolf and lived with them for nine years. If, during this period, he stood away from the man, then he could return to the pond and after crossing it, he recovered his human form, aged nine years. He indicated that he even found his old clothes.<br />
According to certain superstitions, stealing the clothes of a lycanthropist prevented him from regaining his human form. In France,</p>
<p>In France, around 1131, Hugues de Camp d&#8217;Avesnes, Count of Saint-Pol, called the Canterine Beast, was changed into a werewolf by divine force because of the terrible crimes he had committed. During the night he could be seen wandering through the streets, screaming, loaded with chains.</p>
<p>The angels, the priests and some saints apparently also possessed the power to launch this curse. Saint Thomas Aquinas had a maxim on this subject: &#8220;Omnes angeli, boni and Mali, ex virtue naturali habent potestatem transmutandi corpus nostra&#8221; (All angels, good or bad have the power to transform our bodies).<br />
Saint Natalis would have cursed an Irish family whose members had become wolves for seven years and Saint Patrick would have transformed the Welsh king Vereticus into a wolf. The excommunicated Catholics, for their part, were suspected of being werewolves. In other tales the divine intervention was even more direct and in Russia a legend related that men had become werewolves after incurring the wrath of the devil.</p>

<p>According to some popular beliefs, sorcerers, gods and the Devil could easily change a man into a wolf (or a wild beast) by throwing a curse on him.<br />
In the fifth century BC Herodotus, in his Histories, recounted that the Greeks who had established themselves on the shores of the Black Sea in the north-east of Scythia regarded the members of the Neur tribe as skilled strong magicians who Were transformed into wolves once a year, for several days, before resuming their human appearance.<br />
The Neures observe the same customs as the Scythians. It seems that these people are enchanters. Indeed, if we are to believe the Scythians and the Greeks established in Scythia, each Neure changes once a year into a wolf for a few days, and then resumes its first form. The Scythians may well say, they will not make me believe such tales; It is not that they support them, and even with an oath.<br />
In Polish folklore, if a witch threw a human skin belt on the threshold of a house in which a marriage was celebrated, then the husband and wife, the damsels and the groomsmen turned into wolves . After three years, the witch covered the skin of their hair and they then found their human form.<br />
On this subject, an anecdote related that a sorceress having thrown a skin too small on the husband, when it resumed its human form, it retained its tail of wolf. If a witch threw a human skin belt on the threshold of a house in which a marriage was celebrated, then the husband and wife, the damsels and the groomsmen turned into wolves. After three years, the witch covered the skin of their hair and they then found their human form. On this subject, an anecdote related that a sorceress having thrown a skin too small on the husband, when it resumed its human form, it retained its tail of wolf. If a witch threw a human skin belt on the threshold of a house in which a marriage was celebrated, then the husband and wife, the damsels and the groomsmen turned into wolves. After three years, the witch covered the skin of their hair and they then found their human form. On this subject, an anecdote related that a sorceress having thrown a skin too small on the husband, when it resumed its human form, it retained its tail of wolf.</p>
<p>Sorcerers were able to cast a curse that changed their enemies into werewolves, but most often they chose to transform themselves in order to satisfy their appetites of human flesh. They performed a ritual during which various satanic allegiances were pronounced. If the ritual was properly followed, the invoker could take on the appearance of the wolf by putting on his skin.<br />
In this new form he attacked the herds and the men, whose flesh he devoured. He could, of course, regain his original form when he wished. In the 12th century, according to William of Palermo, many wizards roamed the fields during the nights of full moon, equipped with wolf skins, in order to frighten the populations.<br />
Thievenne Paget, Who was a witch, also changed into a she-wolf, according to her own confession. Thus metamorphosed, she accompanied the Devil in mountains and valleys, killing cows and devouring children. Claude Isan Prost, a lame woman, Clauda Isan Guillaume and Isan Roquet, who participated in the murder of five children, apparently did as much.</p>
<p>In Norway, it was thought that some people could take the form of a bear or a wolf and then return to their human form by their own will. This faculty was transmitted to them by the Trollmen, and those who possessed it were themselves called Trolls.<br />
In a hamlet, in the midst of a forest, a man named Lasse lived in a cottage with his wife. One day he went to the forest to cut down a tree, but before forgetting to cross himself and say his Pater, so that some trolls or wolves took control easily and turned it into a wolf. His wife wept for many years, but on Christmas Eve a truly poor beggar with ragged clothes knocked at her door. The woman of the house was good. After having made her go home, She nurtured it, and treated it with kindness. Before leaving, the beggar told the woman that she would probably be happy to see her husband again, for he was not dead but he was walking in the forest like a wolf. At nightfall, the woman went to her pantry to pick up a piece of meat for the next day when suddenly, as she turned to go out, she caught sight of a wolf standing on her paws looking at her With a sad and hungry air. Seeing that, the woman exclaimed: &#8220;I&#8217;m sure you were my Lasse, I&#8217;ll give you some meat.<br />
At that moment the skin of a wolf disappeared. In front of her now was her husband in the clothes he wore the day she had seen him for the last time. It is easy to distinguish in this moralistic fable,</p>
<p>In the Satyricon, Niceros related that he had been invited to the banquet of one of his friends and that he had suddenly turned into a wolf. According to Niceros: &#8220;When I turned to my friend, I saw that he had taken off his clothes and had piled them by the side of the road. He sat in a circle around his clothes, and then, like that, turned into a wolf! He uttered loud howls and then fled into the woods. &#8221;<br />
Legend of the Lithuanian folklore assured that it was also possible to turn into a werewolf carelessly touching glasses with a werewolf when he gave a transmission formula. In his collection Chansons du peuple russe, Ralston also gave an incantation which still remains popular in Russia today.</p>
<p>In the 9th century Nennius reported in his <em>Historia Brittonum</em> that some Celtic men were reputed to be able to take the form of a wolf at will through a diabolical force derived from their ancestors. They attacked the sheep, and when they were pursued by people armed with sticks, they fled as quickly as possible.<br />
When they wanted to transform themselves, they left their human bodies, but they had firmly told their loved ones that they should not change their positions because, if they did, they could never take back human form again. If someone wounded them in their wolf form, the wound was visible at the same place on their human body.</p>

<p>If Lycanthropy was often connected to the Devil, there is a rare and little known tale, that of an old man named Thiess. In 1692, at Jurgenburg, in Livonia, Thiess testified under oath that he and the other werewolves were the dogs of God. He claimed that they were warriors who had gone to hell with witches and demons. Their efforts had ensured that the Devil and his henchmen did not carry the grain of the last harvests into hell.<br />
Thiess was firm in his assertions, saying that werewolves in Germany and Russia had also fought the devil&#8217;s henchmen in their own versions of hell. He maintained that when the werewolves died, their souls were welcomed into heaven in thanksgiving for their service.</p>
<p>In some countries, children with physical characteristics or those born at certain dates were predisposed to become werewolves. The Serbs, Poles, and Slovenes asserted that children who were born with hair or a task of wine had the gift of double vision and could be transformed into different animals. The wolf was, of course, the animal they preferred. The belief in this phenomenon was so strong that in the 16th century the Church of Russia felt obliged to condemn it.</p>
<p>According to the Galician tradition, the seventh son of a family could be normal or a werewolf. If it was normal, the child had the image of a cross or the wheel of St. Catherine in his mouth, and if he was a werewolf, he had no sign. That a brother sponsors the child for his baptism and confirmation could prevent the metamorphosis. If no brother was available, then baptizing the child by the name of Bieito could also prevent him from becoming a werewolf.<br />
Children born during the full moon, those who were conceived on the eve of a Sunday or a holy day, those born on Christmas day, those with a tail embryo and those who were born with a piece Of placenta on the head) were more likely than others to become werewolves.</p>
<p>In the south of France, it was believed that destiny destined certain men to become lycanthropists. The desire to run came to them at night. They then left their beds, jumped out of the window, and plunged into a fountain. When they came out, they were covered with dense fur, walked on all fours, and wandered through fields and meadows, forests and villages, biting all the animals and human beings they found on Their path. As they approached dawn, they would return to the fountain, plunge into it, lose their fur skins and find their empty beds.</p>
<p>For those who wanted to transform themselves voluntarily into lycanthrope, the thing was relatively easy. One of the simplest ways to turn into a wolf for someone who had no knowledge of magic was to take off his clothes, wear a wolf skin belt or rub his body with various magic ointments .<br />
In 1603, Judge Henri Boguet in The Speech of Wizards emphasized the use of such ointments:<br />
&#8220;Many confessed that, in order to put themselves in wolves, they rubbed themselves with a certain fat; That afterwards the devil affixed to them a wolf&#8217;s skin covering their whole body; After which they set themselves on all fours, and ran among the fields, sometimes after a person, and sometimes after a beast, as their appetites guided or transported them.<br />
It was also possible to drink rain water in the print in wolf or other wild animal, to drink water from a spring where the wolves came to drink, to devour the brains of a wolf, A wolf or sleeping at the place where the beast usually rested. Beer mixed with blood was known to accelerate the metamorphosis sought.<br />
In the 16th century, the Swedish writer Olaus Magnus stated that the werewolves of Livonia had been initiated after drinking a cup of specially prepared beer by repeating an established formula. Beer mingled with blood was known to accelerate the metamorphosis sought. In the 16th century, the Swedish writer Olaus Magnus stated that the werewolves of Livonia had been initiated after drinking a cup of specially prepared beer by repeating an established formula. Beer mingled with blood was known to accelerate the metamorphosis sought. In the 16th century, the Swedish writer Olaus Magnus stated that the werewolves of Livonia had been initiated after drinking a cup of specially prepared beer by repeating an established formula.</p>
<p>In Galicia, a person could become a werewolf by throwing his clothes and leaving his home every Friday. He then had to visit seven villages, and clothe himself in each. He could regain his human form by burning one of the skins he was wearing or bleeding.<br />
In France, Italy and Germany it was thought that man could turn into a wolf if he slept alone outside during certain summer nights on Wednesdays and Fridays and if the full moon directly illuminated his face .<br />
In Russia, the werewolf is called an Oborot. Beliefs affirmed that to become Oborot, one had to follow the following ceremonial:<br />
One who wants to become an Oborot, that he seeks in the forest a small tree and that he stabs it with a knife of copper. He will then walk around the tree, repeating a certain incantation and throwing himself three times against the tree. He can then run into the forest, transformed into a wolf.<br />
In Denmark he said to himself that if a woman lay between four sticks the membrane that wraps a foal at her birth and then sneaks through it, naked, then she would give birth without pain but all the boys she would have would be wolves- And all the daughters of the maras.</p>
<p>It would seem that in some cases, lycanthropy was not the result of a metamorphosis of the body but of a journey of the soul. When a soul was damned, she could not find repose, and sometimes she came out of her grave under the guise of a wolf. This soul then set off in search of a host, and there was generally a fierce struggle between the original soul and the damned soul who sought to take possession of this body. If the damned soul were to win, then the host turned into a werewolf.<br />
In the 1st century, Arétée of Cappadocia spoke of certain men who were persuaded to be made of glass. They were afraid of being broken, in which case they were transformed into wolves. Their behavior became similar in all respects to the animal. They preferred to go out at night, scream at death, and,</p>
<p>The number seven, supposedly sacred, was frequently associated with werewolves. Some lycanthropes were thus condemned to live seven years in their form of wolf in expiation of their crimes or so that the spell cast on them ceases. Each night they had to go through seven parishes and walk around seven bell towers before finding a place in Hell. Breaking Lent seven years in a row was undeniably leading to a metamorphosis.<br />
By their own admission, lycanthropists often united themselves in wolves, and they asserted that their pleasure was intense. When the metamorphosis ceased and the werewolf resumed its human form, he felt physically weak and morally tortured.</p>
<h2>Recognizing a Werewolf</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963" src="http://www.mindshadow.fr/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/lycanthrope.jpg" alt="lycanthrope" width="343" height="250" /></p>
<p>Due to its suspicious and cunning nature, it was difficult to recognize a werewolf as it evolved in its human form. Yet, some signs were revealing because the lycanthropes sometimes retained characteristics specific to their metamorphosis. <span class="ContentBox" data-cd="Text">Bushy eyebrows, red teeth, ears a little lower than normal and behind the head, hairy hands inside the palms, flat and webbed fingers, the middle finger and index finger of the same length , Squat thumbs, slightly reddish or curled nails, a change in the voice where eyes, and in general, hairs on the hands, feet and back were signs that tended to testify to the true nature Of the suspect. </span><span class="ContentBox" data-cd="Text">A strange fatigue, </span>A sad or melancholy look and a sudden lack of appetite were also signs not to be overlooked. The rumor also claimed that his thirst was inextinguishable and that it was almost impossible for him to shed tears.</p>
<p>During the medieval period and the Renaissance, the classic method of formally recognizing a werewolf was to incise the skin of the alleged lycanthropist to see whether hairs were hidden there because, according to certain French and Quebecois legends, Had to turn his skin and turn into a werewolf, as this anecdote testifies:<br />
&#8220;Pomponace, a peasant suffering from lycanthropy, was shouted to his neighbors to escape if they did not want to&#8221; He eats them. As the poor man was not in the shape of a wolf, the villagers, convinced that he was, had begun to flay him to see if he did not wear the hair under his skin. Pomponace cured him, as many others would have been cured if it had not been better to burn them to frighten the indignities.<br />
According to a Russian belief, a lycanthrope could easily be unmasked by the hairs he had under his tongue.<br />
In Hungarian and Balkan folklore, many werewolves were described as vampiric witches who became wolves in order to suck the blood of men who were born on a full moon day. In their human form, these werewolves were pale, had an emaciated face, hollow sockets, swollen lips and flabby arms. As soon as the lycanthrope was formally identified, it was possible to administer a remedy, to enclose it in order to judge it, or to execute it. Many werewolves were described as vampiric witches who became wolves in order to suck the blood of men who were born on a full moon day. In their human form, these werewolves were pale, had an emaciated face, hollow sockets, swollen lips and flabby arms. As soon as the lycanthrope was formally identified, it was possible to administer a remedy, to enclose it in order to judge it, or to execute it. Many werewolves were described as vampiric witches who became wolves in order to suck the blood of men who were born on a full moon day. In their human form, these werewolves were pale, had an emaciated face, hollow sockets, swollen lips and flabby arms. As soon as the lycanthrope was formally identified, it was possible to administer a remedy, to enclose it in order to judge it, or to execute it.</p>
<p>In most legends a werewolf had no means of changing its condition, and only death could deliver it. Yet different remedies were recognized as effective in fighting wolf transformation, and there were many ways to cure lycanthropes, which varied according to the time, country and myth.<br />
In most cases it was assumed that lycanthropy resulted from a curse or possession and it was therefore sufficient to practice an exorcism in order to drive away the demonic spirit that had seized the body of the unfortunate.<br />
In ancient times, in order to cure people with lycanthropy, Greeks and Romans believed in the power of exhaustion. The lycanthrope was then subjected to long periods of physical activity in the hope of ridding him of this disease. This practice resulted from the fact that many suspected werewolves felt weak when they regained their human form.<br />
In Scandinavia, western Russia and central Europe, some 15th-century legends reported the existence of magic philters that could help the werewolves regain their original appearance.<br />
In Denmark a simple reprimand could overcome lycanthropy, and in some parts of Germany it was claimed that a werewolf could be cured if his name was baptized three times. In the middle Ages, The conversion to Christianity was one of the methods used and a devotion to Saint-Hubert was advocated both as a remedy and protection.<br />
Scandinavian, Western Russian and Central European legends mentioned magic philtres which were able to restore its human aspect to the lycanthropist. These philters were prepared with aconite, a plant also known as wolf-wolf.</p>
<p>While some of the methods were relatively mild, most remedies advocated by medieval doctors were unfortunately fatal to patients.<br />
In order to restore his human appearance to the lycanthrope, it was also possible to find the skin of a wolf that he used to transform himself and that he concealed in a secret place, usually a tree stump, in order to burn it. The werewolf then suffered terribly and uttered frightful cries of pain, but he was eventually delivered from his curse.<br />
According to a Quebec belief, the lycanthrope had to be marked at the bottom by carving a cross with a knife, in memory of Christ, or prick it and shed its blood in memory of the martyrdom of Christ.<br />
A former Sicilian superstition claimed that a werewolf could be cured of his disease if he was beaten on the forehead or scalp with a knife, or if his hands were pierced with nails. They could also be beaten with a key or shed his blood because a few drops of blood poured had to make him recover his human form. Once cured, an ancient lycanthrope usually kept the ability to understand the language of wolves.</p>
<h2>Protecting yourself from a Werewolf</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-967" src="http://www.mindshadow.fr/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/pendaison-loup-garou.jpg" alt="Hanging a Werewolf" width="513" height="250" /></p>
<p>If a lycanthrope roamed around, there were very few ways to protect themselves effectively. In Belgium, the rowan was considered to be efficient and it was thought that a house sheltered by the shadow of a rowan was a place on. To stop a werewolf, there was a simple but hazardous way. It was enough to take keys and throw them behind while facing the lycanthropist. It could also be sprinkled with water, which logically had to make him regain human form. By throwing him holy water, the Werewolf sometimes disappeared but he could also turn into a goblin or a vampire. However, this transformation lasted from 1 day to 3 weeks, which generally allowed the victim to escape.<br />
One could also try to poison the evil creature. But it was a relatively risky and generally discouraged method, for the werewolf, being half animal, had a powerful sense of smell. Therefore, he could easily detect any toxic substance. According to some beliefs, cutting off the paw of a werewolf could destroy the charm of his metamorphosis, forcing him to regain his human form, but with a sliced ​​hand or foot. The sensitivity of the werewolves to religious objects such as holy water and crucifixes is a relatively recent belief. Thus obliging him to regain his human form, but with a sliced ​​hand or foot. The sensitivity of the werewolves to religious objects such as holy water and crucifixes is a relatively recent belief. Thus obliging him to regain his human form, but with a sliced ​​hand or foot. The sensitivity of the werewolves to religious objects such as holy water and crucifixes is a relatively recent belief.</p>

<p class="wp-caption-text">The Beast of Changy</p>
</div>
<p>If all the methods of protecting himself from the werewolf were ineffective and no one could identify the responsible person, then he had to be killed when he metamorphoses into a wolf. But the lycanthropes were skilful creatures who often escaped traps and their harsh skin effectively protected them from conventional attacks. However, the wounds made to the werewolves when they were in their animal form were generally found on their human body, which made it easy to recognize them later. The lycanthropists had great resistance and quickly recovered their physical integrity, even though their limbs were severed but decapitation was an undeniable means of overcoming them.</p>
<p>Weapons and silver objects, such as spears, bullets, swords, daggers, or arrows, were deemed to be effective. It was better, however, to bless these weapons, and this blessing was to take place at night, at precise times. Rare and precious objects and a chapel dedicated to Saint-Hubert could further accentuate the effectiveness of the blessings. In the nineteenth century, when the beast of Gevaudan was killed by a silver bullet, the vulnerability of the werewolves to money became indisputable. In Brittany, it was preferred to decapitate the lycanthropus with an ax or a scythe before throwing his body into the river. In the Middle Ages, as witnessed by the numerous executions for lycanthropy, fire and hanging were also effective ways of putting an end to the evil deeds of the evil creature.</p>
<p>In some parts of Germany, northern France and Poland, it was generally accepted that people who died in mortal sin returned in the form of a wolf to drink blood before returning to their homes. Envelope human body from the first gleams of the sun. These lycanthropes were decapitated with a knife and exorcised by the parish priest, and then their head was thrown into a stream, where the crushing weight of their sins dragged him to the bottom.</p>
<p>But even after their death, lycanthropists could still be a problem. Until the 20th century the Greeks believed that the corpses of werewolves that were not destroyed returned to life as wolves, hyenas or vampires and roamed the battlefields to drink the blood of the dying soldiers .</p>
<p>Rural people believed in the existence of werewolves ravaging the countryside and attacking animals as well as humans, and when a person was recognized as a lycanthropist, his judgment was without appeal. However, lycanthropy, as a physical metamorphosis, posed problems from its supernatural side and aroused a certain incredulity among thinkers and scholars and this from ancient Greece. Pliny the Elder indicated that it was not necessary to believe in it, and the Greek physician Arétée assimilated lycanthropy to a disease.<br />
Moreover, the status of werewolves was incompatible with the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church as they were considered a demonic manifestation. The Bible gave no explanation of them, and the theologians were obliged to find one by themselves. It emerged that the demon could not in any case transform a human body into that of a wolf thanks to its magical powers, for only God possessed the power of creation.<br />
The theory that a demon or sorcerer could project his soul into the body of a wolf was also rejected because their powers could not be equivalent to two of God.<br />
Thomas Aquinas, relying on the writings of Augustine Hippome, asserted that metamorphoses were illusions of the Devil, which did not affect either the body or the soul, but the phantasticum, a sort of phantom projection of the &#8221; man. The metamorphosis into wolf was therefore an illusion. It emerged that the demon could not in any case transform a human body into that of a wolf thanks to its magical powers, for only God possessed the power of creation. The theory that a demon or sorcerer could project his soul into the body of a wolf was also rejected because their powers could not be equivalent to two of God. Thomas Aquinas, relying on the writings of Augustine Hippome, asserted that metamorphoses were illusions of the Devil, which did not affect either the body or the soul, but the phantasticum, a sort of phantom projection of the &#8221; man. The metamorphosis into wolf was therefore an illusion. It emerged that the demon could not in any case transform a human body into that of a wolf thanks to its magical powers, for only God possessed the power of creation. The theory that a demon or sorcerer could project his soul into the body of a wolf was also rejected because their powers could not be equivalent to two of God. Thomas Aquinas, relying on the writings of Augustine Hippome, asserted that metamorphoses were illusions of the Devil, which did not affect either the body or the soul, but the phantasticum, a sort of phantom projection of the &#8221; man. The metamorphosis into wolf was therefore an illusion. The theory that a demon or sorcerer could project his soul into the body of a wolf was also rejected because their powers could not be equivalent to two of God. Thomas Aquinas, relying on the writings of Augustine Hippome, asserted that metamorphoses were illusions of the Devil, which did not affect either the body or the soul, but the phantasticum, a sort of phantom projection of the &#8221; man. The metamorphosis into wolf was therefore an illusion. The theory that a demon or sorcerer could project his soul into the body of a wolf was also rejected because their powers could not be equivalent to two of God. Thomas Aquinas, relying on the writings of Augustine Hippome, asserted that metamorphoses were illusions of the Devil, which did not affect either the body or the soul, but the phantasticum, a sort of phantom projection of the &#8221; man. The metamorphosis into wolf was therefore an illusion. A sort of phantom projection of man. The metamorphosis into wolf was therefore an illusion. A sort of phantom projection of man. The metamorphosis into wolf was therefore an illusion.</p>
<p>During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the beliefs remained perennial and the lawsuits for lycanthropy were very numerous. Those who expressed doubts as to the veracity of the phenomenon took the risk of being suspected of sympathy for the sorcerers. The skeptics were few and the doctors were very discreet. The werewolves were detested by the inquisitors, who mercilessly pursued them. A large number of unfortunate accused of lycanthropia were burned daily, and the theologians and devotees complained continually that they were not burning enough.</p>
<p>Henry Boguet, a notorious Inquisitor, had nine cases involving werewolves. He thought the werewolf was a direct manifestation of the Devil.<br />
According to him, Satan abandoned the sleeping lycanthropus in a bush and brought out a wolf. The animal then committed crimes that haunted the mind of the sleeper and disturbed his imagination to such an extent that the lycanthropus had really believed he had metamorphosed into a wolf. He therefore thought he had run the campaign by massacring animals and human beings. Although the reality of physical transformation was questioned in this theory, the werewolf was still held accountable for his actions because he had agreed with the demon, which was an extremely serious crime.</p>
<p>Delancre reported this anecdote on a Duke of Russia, who, warned that his subject was changing into all sorts of animals, sent for him; And, after having chained him, commanded him to make an experiment of his art; Which he soon changed into a wolf; but this duke, having prepared two mastiffs, made them spring against this wretch, who was at once beaten to pieces.</p>
<p>Aristide Dey described the nature of the so-called werewolves thus:<br />
&#8220;In remote times, where obscurantism and superstitions reigned, beings depraved by misery, exalted out of the ways of humanity by the use of intoxicating drugs, Covered themselves with the skin of a wolf, trained themselves to run four feet, and, throwing terror into the people in this disguise, lived through depradations and went so far as to feed on human flesh. &#8221;</p>

<p>From the end of the Middle Ages to the Renaissance, over a hundred years ago, many reports of werewolf attacks and nearly 30,000 lycanthropic trials were recorded in France. It is estimated that the number of trials in Europe was 100,000 but according to Collin de Plancy, tens of thousands of other suspected lycanthropists would have perished without trial, victims of popular vindictiveness.</p>
<p>In some cases there was evidence of murder and cannibalism, without any association with wolves, and in other cases people were simply frightened by wolves. Those found guilty of lycanthropy were burnt at the stake or skinned alive, for legend had it that the hairs of the wolf were concealed under his skin. And sometimes, more rarely, they were hanged, quite simply. At the beginning of the seventeenth century, sorcery was condemned by James I of England and it was not until July 21, 1682, that trials of witchcraft were banned in France.</p>
<p>In 1182, Giraldus claimed to have discovered, in Ireland, a couple of Wolves. But we do not know more about this.</p>
<p>In 1440, Gilles de Rais was executed for acts of barbarism and lycanthropy.</p>
<p>In 1521, Pierre Burgeot and Michel Verdun were accused of lycanthropy by Jean Bodin, the prior of the Dominican convent of Poligny. The trial, which took place at Besancon, attracted a large crowd of curious. The accused were both convicted and burned alive. Their portraits remained posted in the village church to remind everyone what men were capable of doing when they were under the influence of the Devil.<br />
In the same year, three men accused of lycanthropy were burned alive in Besancon. They had admitted that after they had rubbed themselves with fat they changed into wolves, mated with wolves, and devoured several children.</p>
<p>In 1541, in Pavia, Italy, a farmer was suspected of having shredded a large number of people with his teeth while in the form of a wolf. After his capture, he asserted that the only difference between a real wolf and him resided in the fur. She was pushing outward for a wolf, and inwardly for her.</p>
<p>In 1542, according to Henry Boguer, one hundred and fifty werewolves assembled in a square in Constantinople.</p>
<p>In 1573, during the autumn, when a terrible famine was raging, many crimes were committed on children whose bodies were found torn and devoured. Everything indicated that they had been attacked by wolves. The suspicions then turned to Gilles Garnier, a hermit who lived with his family in the middle of the forest of the Serre, in Armange. After being captured, the villagers took him to the Dole court. On 16 January 1574, after the suspect confessed to his crimes, the court delivered his verdict. Among the charges against him, he was accused, among others, of having consumed meat on a Friday, which was formally forbidden. &#8220;Gilles Garnier, who had fallen into witchcraft, had taken and taken several children between the ages of six and twelve, both with his hands as his paws and with his teeth,</p>
<p>In 1584, Pierre Gandillon and his son Georges were arrested and accused of having murdered and devoured many adolescents after smearing the body with an ointment. Their appearance had changed, they moved on all fours, they were provided with nails hard, thick and sharp as claws.</p>
<p>In 1588 Arline de Barioux was burned in the main square of Riom. He was accused of turning into a wolf every Friday afternoon to devour the children.</p>
<p>In 1598, in the Loire valley, Jacques Rollet, a simple-minded man who thought he was a wolf, had been discovered near the bloodied corpse of a 15-year-old boy. Jacques Rollet was already known as the werewolf of Caude.<br />
According to various testimonies, he had fled the place of his crime before being found half naked in the woods. His long hair and big beard were tangled, and his blood-clad hands still held pieces of flesh. In his judgment, Jacques Rollet explained that he had killed judges, lawyers and bailiffs but that the flesh of the latter was hard and tasteless. The court had sentenced him to death but he was considered mentally defective and interned in an asylum where he had stayed for two years.</p>

<p>In 1589 the trial and killing of Peter Stumbb, the most famous killer of the suspected werewolves, took place. He was known as the Werewolf of Bedburg. During his trial, he declared that the devil had given him a magic belt that allowed him to transform into a hungry wolf, a voracious, strong and powerful wolf, with large eyes that shone like fire in the night, a Large mouth with pointed and cruel teeth, a gigantic body and powerful legs. &#8220;.</p>
<p>From the same period, the story of a sanguinary tailor has reached us. The man disguised himself as a wolf and roamed the forests at dusk, attacking children and young people to open their throats. Sometimes he would attract the unfortunate in his shop, he would beat them and cut off their necks before cutting them into pieces, like butcher&#8217;s meat. At his execution he showed no remorse. The record of his trial was so horrible that the court decided not to keep it and ordered it to be destroyed.</p>
<p>In 1603, Jean Grenier of Aquitaine, a young boy of thirteen or fourteen years, was accused of lycanthropy. He was physically retarded and mentally deficient, but he was nevertheless considered responsible for the disappearance of children, including that of an infant in his cradle. After his arrest, he asserted that he was the son of a priest and admitted that he had devoured about fifteen children. In reality, his father was a farmman who was so violent towards him that the boy had fled to escape. Delivered to himself, he lived in a savage manner, subsisted through begging and worked occasionally.<br />
During his trial, the judge took his age and disabilities into account and ordered the boy to be interned for life in a cloister. Seven years later, When Pierre de Lancre visited him, it was explained to him that since his arrival, Jean Grenier refused to eat normally. He apparently preferred devouring filth. He was sickly thin, his eyes were sunk and they were burning with a disturbing glow. His hands, with curled nails, resembled claws, and his teeth were long and pointed. He imitated the wolves and moved on all fours with agility. A year later Jean Grenier died. The story of Jean Grenier of Aquitaine influenced the attitude of the judges on the affairs of lycanthropy. But the trials, the tortures, and the executions that followed were all the same. He was sickly thin, his eyes were sunk and they were burning with a disturbing glow. His hands, with curled nails, resembled claws, and his teeth were long and pointed. He imitated the wolves and moved on all fours with agility. A year later Jean Grenier died. The story of Jean Grenier of Aquitaine influenced the attitude of the judges on the affairs of lycanthropy. But the trials, the tortures, and the executions that followed were all the same. He was sickly thin, his eyes were sunk and they were burning with a disturbing glow. His hands, with curled nails, resembled claws, and his teeth were long and pointed. He imitated the wolves and moved on all fours with agility. A year later Jean Grenier died. The story of Jean Grenier of Aquitaine influenced the attitude of the judges on the affairs of lycanthropy. But the trials, the tortures, and the executions that followed were all the same. The story of Jean Grenier of Aquitaine influenced the attitude of the judges on the affairs of lycanthropy. But the trials, the tortures, and the executions that followed were all the same. The story of Jean Grenier of Aquitaine influenced the attitude of the judges on the affairs of lycanthropy. But the trials, the tortures, and the executions that followed were all the same.</p>
<p>In 1605 Henry Gandinn, a native of Limburg, was accused of turning into a werewolf using sorcery. He was transformed into a wolf in the company of two other men, one of whom was named Jan Wolf.<br />
Henry Gardinn declared at his confession that the three men had attacked, killed and ate a child while they were in the form of a wolf. Henry Gardinn had been found guilty of witchcraft for the purpose of turning into a werewolf, and was condemned to be burned alive. During his arrest, his alleged accomplice, Jan the Wolf, had left the parish, but was arrested two years later and executed in turn.</p>
<p>In 1651 Hans appeared before the tribunal of Idavare. He was accused of being a werewolf for his eighteen years. Hans confessed to being a werewolf for two years. He claimed that he had obtained the body of a wolf by a man in black. When the judges asked him if his body had really taken part in the hunt, or if it was his soul that had been transmuted, Hans replied that he had found on his leg the traces of bites that a dog had made him when &#8216;He was a werewolf.</p>
<p>In 1692, at Jurgenburg, in Livonia, Thiess testified under oath that he and the other werewolves were the dogs of God. He claimed that they were warriors who had gone to hell with witches and demons. Their efforts had ensured that the Devil and his henchmen did not carry the grain of the last harvests into hell.<br />
Thiess was firm in his assertions, saying that werewolves in Germany and Russia had also fought the devil&#8217;s henchmen in their own versions of hell. He maintained that when the werewolves died, their souls were welcomed into heaven in thanksgiving for their service. Thiess was finally sentenced to ten lashes for idolatry and superstitious belief.</p>
<p>Between 1500 and 1700, about 100,000 people were sentenced for lycanthropy and burned alive. During the 17th century, doctors&#8217; explanations of lycanthropy put an end to most tortures and killings. However, the population remained fearful and preferred supernatural explanations. Many instances of animal attacks on herds or men inevitably resurfaced the legend of the werewolf.<br />
Nowadays, there are always people who sincerely believe themselves to be werewolves and others who think that lycanthropes exist and that some human beings really turn into wolves.</p>

<p class="wp-caption-text">The Gevaudan&#8217;s beast</p>
</div>
<p>In 1764, more than 300 people were victims of the Beast of Gevaudan, which raged in Lozère and the surrounding area. She was described as a giant wolf or a werewolf. His story inspired many theories.</p>
<p>In July 1766, the Quebec Gazette announced that a werewolf was running in the county of Kamouraska.</p>
<p>In 1766, the beast of Sarlat, in the Dordogne, massacred fifteen people.</p>
<p>Towards the middle of the 19th century, in a small village in Poland, a werewolf took away the most beautiful girl in the village.</p>
<p>In 1804, a man named Maréchal, accused of lycanthropy, was condemned to the galleys.</p>
<p>In 1853, in Spain, Manuel Blanco Romasanta admitted to killing thirteen people because he suffered from a curse that transformed him into a wolf.</p>
<p>In 1887, a wild coyote terrorized miners in Saskatchewan, Canada. He was struck down with a golden bullet, and the object was extracted from his body. The story was reported by miners to the writer Ed Bodin in 1940.</p>
<p>In 1899, in Pennsylvania, a peaceful old man had a reputation for being a werewolf.</p>
<p>Shortly before the First World War, three werewolves roamed the Belgian Ardennes.<br />
At the same time, in Scotland, a shepherd from the neighborhood of Inverness was suspected of lycanthropy.</p>
<p>In 1925, a young boy from an Alsatian village was accused of being a werewolf.</p>
<p>In 1930, a werewolf was raging in the region of Bourg-la-Reine.</p>
<p>In 1946, a mysterious creature with all the characteristics of the werewolf created terror in a Navajo reserve in North America.</p>
<p>In 1946-1947 a mysterious animal attacked many herds in the canton of Valais, Switzerland. The affair was never elucidated.</p>
<p>In 1949, in Rome, the police had to investigate a strange affair: every month, at the full moon, a man of the city was in the grip of strange hallucinations and uttered sinister howlings.</p>
<p>In 1957, English newspapers reported the sad story of a seventeen-year-old man from the village of Eccles Hall who thought he was going to turn into a werewolf. To put an end to the moral suffering he endured, he had plunged a knife into his heart. The inquest opened after his death revealed that the unfortunate man had telephoned one of his friends before performing his gesture: &#8220;He told me that his face and his hands were changing colors and that he was Become a werewolf. Then he stopped, and then I heard grunts. &#8221;</p>
<p>In Singapore, again in 1957, mysterious aggressions defeated the police. The rumor was that the attackers were werewolves who were attacking the residents of a nursing home. One night, one of the nurses had awakened with a start to see a horrible bestial face whose hair was so low on the forehead that they reached the root of the nose and whose mouth left sharp fangs. The mystery was never elucidated.</p>
<p>In 1975-1976, the Beast of the Vosges who killed many domestic animals was never identified. She reappeared in 1994 and she slaughtered eighty animals.</p>
<p>In 1978, in the south of Brazil, Rosario do Sul, a 16-year-old schoolgirl, was plagued by demonic visions. She asserted that the spirit of a ferocious wolf had seized her.</p>
<p>In 1982, in the Creuse, a carnivorous creature was at the origin of a series of attacks on flocks. The corpses of the animals, including a bull and a heifer of 400 kg, were horribly shredded. In an organized battle in Noth Forest in November 1982, a hunter claimed to have confronted the animal without successfully identifying it. The case has never been elucidated.</p>
<p>In 1988, in Germany, near Wittlich, a creature close to the dog, passed the alarms of a military base and crossed the surrounding wall after standing on its feet. The dogs at the base refused to chase her.</p>
<p>In 2003, in Switzerland, a man was prosecuted for killing his wife with a knife. He told the criminal court in Lausanne: &#8220;I saw his canines growing. They had a strange odor. Like that of a werewolf &#8220;. According to the psychiatric expert report, he maintained a contact with reality.</p>
<p>In 2013, according to some residents of Vallée-Pitot, a werewolf would appear in places where there would be silence in order to spy on women while they were in the shower or sleeping girls. Witnesses asserted that the creature, presented as agile and particularly fast, would sometimes resound its heavy steps on the roof of houses.</p>
