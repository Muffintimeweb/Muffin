          <p>In a strange way, the dead sometimes telephoned relatives or strangers to deliver messages. Many witnesses have reported their experiences, and their stories are all alike. The phone rings, sometimes with a different ring, even if it is disconnected or out of operation. The line is crackling, sometimes a wind seems to blow, the voice is distant, the communication brief, often unique but not always. Most of the time, the messages consist of mundane love words, posthumous happiness assurance, comfort words or warnings, and then the communication abruptly breaks down. In the case of multiple appeals, the deceased often repeats the same sentence as, for example, &#8220;It&#8217;s cold here&#8221; or &#8220;Why did you bury me next to grandmother?&#8221; &#8221;</p>
<p>Often calls are anonymous and untraceable but sometimes the number of the missing or strange numbers, such as &#8220;000 000 0000,&#8221; are displayed on the screen. In case of absence, some would even leave messages on answering machines or voice mail. The recipients of these calls are rarely involved in paranormal research, they are generally frightened by the phenomenon and fearing ridicule, they are reluctant to talk about it. Many cases have, however, been referenced in the world, which have been reported in books, magazines and newspaper articles.</p>
<p>In 1979, D. Scott Rogo and Raymond Bayless, two parapsychologists, have written a book about these phone calls from the beyond, <em>Phone Calls From the Dead</em> , featuring many well-documented cases. In one of these stories, several people were simultaneously talking to the missing and in another, the recipient spoke for a moment, then handed the handset to someone else when the mind asked.</p>
<h2> Pierre Monnier</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29467" src="http://www.mindshadow.fr/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/pierre-monnier.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 165px) 100vw, 165px" srcset="http://www.mindshadow.fr/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/pierre-monnier.jpg 165w, http://www.mindshadow.fr/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/pierre-monnier-99x150.jpg 99w" alt="Pierre Monnier" width="165" height="250" /></p>
<p>On January 8, 1915, Pierre Monnier, a young man of good family who had gone to war the year before, called his mother to reassure her, but it was her young cousin who answered the telephone: &#8220;Dagmar, tell mamma that I am alive. &#8221;</p>
<p>When she heard the news, her mother, Mrs. Cécile Monnier, called the telephone to find out where the call came from, but the operator told her that no one had asked for her number. Two days later, the gendarmes appeared at his door to inform him of Pierre&#8217;s death on January 8th on the front of Argonne. He was then twenty-three years old. On Monday, August 5, 1918, Mrs. Monnier received a telepathic message from her son, who commanded him: &#8220;Do not think of anything! Write! &#8221;</p>
<p>The poor woman, who believed that Pierre had sent her a sign on the day of her death, quickly grabbed a pencil and a little notebook and began to write the words of her son: &#8220;Yes, Asked to write. I believe that by this means we will be able to communicate much more easily. I&#8217;m so happy to be able to talk to you as I used to &#8230; &#8221;</p>
<p>For more than twenty years, Cécile Monnier kept the messages that Pierre sent her through automatic writing. These texts, mainly spiritual, were then collected and published in a book in seven volumes,  <em>The Letters of Peter</em> .</p>
<h2>Ida Lupino</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29468" src="http://www.mindshadow.fr/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ida-lupino.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" srcset="http://www.mindshadow.fr/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ida-lupino.jpg 200w, http://www.mindshadow.fr/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ida-lupino-120x150.jpg 120w" alt="Ida Lupino" width="200" height="250" /></p>
<p>During the Second World War, Ida Lupino, an actress who lived in Los Angeles, received a phone call from her father, who had died six months earlier. The family home of the Lupino family, which was located in London, had just been destroyed by a bomb, and as no one knew where its title was, the family could not get the insurance money, An embarrassing situation. During this call, his father described to him with the greatest precision the place of the cellar where the papers were hidden. The young woman then informed her family and the documents were found at the indicated location. Mrs. Pendleton, a friend of the actress, witnessed this phone call and she vouched for the authenticity of the story.</p>
<h2>The Peggy Fox Case</h2>

<p>On a Saturday morning in June 1960 in Toronto, Canada, Mrs. Fox was waiting for a call from her mother when the telephone bell rang in her fourth floor apartment. &#8220;I picked up the phone and almost fainted when I heard the voice. It was my daughter, Peggy. I immediately recognized him. She said, &#8220;Hello mom! Can you hear me? Do not be sad ! I am so happy ! Then the line was cut off. I stood there, motionless, unable to move, in shock. &#8221;</p>
<p>Peggy, Mrs. Fox&#8217;s daughter, died six months earlier, during the winter of 1959, a victim of a viral infection. She was twelve years old. Her mother, who worked half-time as a secretary, had gone through dark hours, but she was beginning to feel a little better. Finally, until that phone call &#8230; An hour later, when her husband, Paul, returned home, he found her in tears. She immediately told him his incredible experience and he concluded that someone had to make a joke of bad taste. Enervé, he immediately contacted the telephone company to find out the number of the joker but it appeared that nobody had called them from the morning.</p>
<p>Two days later, Paul was in the room when his wife answered the phone and seeing her turn pale, he understood at once. He quickly snatched the receiver, just in time to hear: &#8220;It&#8217;s Peggy, Mom do not cry &#8230;&#8221; Then suddenly the line was cut off. Shocked, Paul Fox contacted the phone company again, but no trace of the call could be found: &#8220;I could swear it was my daughter&#8217;s voice &#8230; Yet I was there when her coffin was taken down in the fall … &#8221;</p>
<p>In the following week, Ms. Fox received another call from the voice, which asked her to &#8220;spend the morning in Minou. This nickname was the one that Peggy had affectionately given to his maternal grandfather and no one knew him except his parents and her. &#8220;Nobody knew that, except for my daughter,&#8221; Fox said. &#8220;His words and the tone of his voice were identical to those of Peggy. She had the same funny way to pronounce the &#8220;th&#8221; as Peggy. I refuse to believe that someone was imitating him. &#8221;</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards, the story, which had been reported in the papers, attracted the attention of Dr. John Craggs, psychologist at the University of Chicago and psychic researcher, and he decided to investigate. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure Mr. and Mrs. Fox are telling the truth about these calls. There is absolutely no reason to think they are lying. With the agreement of the family, he installed a recording device that was to be triggered at the ringing of the phone. On August 3, 1960, Mrs. Fox answered the telephone as usual and the voice that resembled her daughter&#8217;s voice said:</p>
<p>&#8211; I love you. Tell Dad I love him too. I am very happy. Please do not cry like you did last time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Peggy, my dear, is it really you?&#8221; Asked Mrs. Fox.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must not be hurt.&#8221; I will try to &#8230; And suddenly, the communication was interrupted.</p>
<p>Dr. Craggs&#8217;s system worked perfectly: &#8220;The tape was shown to several of Peggy&#8217;s friends who all recognized his voice. The tape was preserved and is now in the archives of the American Society for Psychical Research.</p>
<p>Dr. Craggs concluded that external influences could manipulate the electrical pulses of telephones. This hypothesis may seem surprising, but in the case of Peggy Fox, no one has ever proposed a better one.</p>

<p>In 1969, a young New Jersey rock musician, Karl Uphoff, received a call from his grandmother, who had died two days earlier. Karl was eighteen at the time of the incident and he had always had a special connection with his grandmother, who was deaf. Sometimes she phoned her friends and she asked them, &#8220;Is Karl in your house?&#8221; Then, as she knew she could not hear the answer, she said without delay: &#8220;Tell her to go home.&#8221; Egotistically, Karl&#8217;s friends were annoyed at these constant calls and they were lecturing him for giving their number to the old lady.</p>
<p>Karl was overwhelmed by the disappearance of his grandmother, and as he did not believe in the survival of the soul, he never thought of hearing it again. Two days after his death, Karl was in the basement of an apartment in Montclair, New Jersey, when a friend&#8217;s mother went down to pick him up and told him he was being asked over the phone. Karl went up immediately and took the handset and an old woman began to talk to him, which he immediately recognized as his grandmother. He tried to ask her how she would call him when she was dead, but she hung up without answering.</p>
<p>Many more phone calls followed, but every time he asked about life after death, the old woman hung up. Finally, the calls ceased, but Frank was not saddened. He knew, even if she did not talk to him, that his grandmother was still there, near him.</p>

<p>In 1977, in Wilmslow, Cheshire, a young woman named Mary Meredith claimed to have received a phone call from her cousin Shirley, who lived in Manchester and had just heard of her death. The girl had been the victim of a car accident an hour earlier, and she had not survived. Mary would have liked to question her, but she did not have time. Shirley uttered a few words in a distant, disturbed voice, then silence.</p>
<h2>Ken Webster</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-29473 size-full" src="http://www.mindshadow.fr/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ken-webster.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 236px) 100vw, 236px" srcset="http://www.mindshadow.fr/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ken-webster.jpg 236w, http://www.mindshadow.fr/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ken-webster-150x150.jpg 150w" alt="Ken Webster" width="236" height="236" /></p>
<p>In 1984, Ken and Debbie Webster moved to the small village of Doddleston, England, and when they arrived in the house they noticed strange phenomena. The tin cans moved by themselves and rearranged in the cupboards, newspapers levitated above the table, imprints appeared in the dust etc &#8230;</p>
<p>Then one day Ken, who was a university professor, brought back a computer to work at home and mysterious messages began to arrive, which he found on his hard drive and which seemed to come from nowhere. Troubled, Ken and Debbie decided to study the phenomenon scientifically. If a spirit wanted to communicate with them through the PC, then they would give him the opportunity. They left the PC to turn day and night, and in fifteen months they received nearly two hundred and fifty messages from a certain Thomas Harden, who pretended to live, and not to have lived, under Henry VIII. He spoke in an English Middle Ages, using old names fallen into disuse to designate certain places and nicknames to talk about his contemporaries. His vocabulary, his spelling,</p>
<p>Apparently Thomas Harden did not know he was dead. He recounted his memories as if they were from the previous day, and it proved impossible to make him admit that King Henry VIII had not been there long ago. He said he lived in the house they were occupying now and communicated with them through a &#8220;light box.&#8221; He was even afraid of being arrested for witchcraft if anyone ever found out.</p>
<p>The dialogue continued until the computer crashed. It was later repaired, but Thomas Harden never reappeared.</p>
<h2>The History of Sadie</h2>

<p>In the late 1980s, Sadie, who lived in Manchester, England, lost her husband in tragic circumstances and inherited a considerable sum. Shortly after, she moved to an old house on the outskirts of Sandbach with her seven-year-old daughter, Abigail. In a strange way, the landlord was only asking for a modest rent for the cottage, and Sadie would have liked to ask her about it but she thought the question was inappropriate and she had not dared to ask it during her visit. She began by cleansing the house, which was abominably dusty, then she adapted it to her liking and little by little she fell in love. She loved more than all the back garden, a peaceful place where a weeping willow nostalgic enthroned in the middle of a neglected lawn.</p>
<p>Three months after their arrival, one evening in December, Abigail told her mother with enthusiasm that she had just seen a &#8220;sort of old woman in a long black robe standing under the willow. The little girl, who did not seem frightened, explained with a smile that she had greeted him with her hand and that the old lady had disappeared. Abigail was a calm child who did not have the habit of imagining things or inventing fanciful stories, and her mother immediately worried. No one ever saw the ghost, but soon after, strange phenomena began to occur in the house.</p>
<p>One night, Abigail told her mother she was feeling sick and Sadie put her to bed earlier than usual. In the afternoon, the little girl had helped her to pull the weeds out of the garden, and as she was not used to it, her mother thought she was tired. Sadie then retired into the bedroom with a book.</p>
<p>An hour had elapsed when a blow struck the front door of the house, and wondering who could come to her house at twenty-three, the young woman was alarmed. She came down in slippers and nightgown in the entrance hall, and in a nervous voice she cried out through the door: &#8220;Who is there? &#8221;</p>
<p>A man, speaking in a loud voice, replied that he was a doctor, and that he had been called to examine a girl named Abigail. Sadie unlocked the door and opened it carefully, she looked out. A gray-haired man stood on the landing, a briefcase in one hand, a card in the other. Glancing quickly at the piece of cardboard, he asked her, &#8220;Are you all right &#8230; Sadie? Strangely, he knew his surname.</p>
<p>Surprised, the young woman explained that she had not called anybody, but as he was a doctor and his daughter was ill, she invited him back and took him to Abigail&#8217;s room. After examining the girl, who had strange red patches on her arms, the doctor explained to Sadie that her daughter had all the symptoms of meningitis. The man himself took Abigail and his mother to the hospital, where the disease was categorically identified. However, as it had been in its infancy, antibiotics soon came to an end. No one ever knew who had called the doctor for Abigail. Sadie was greatly disturbed by this mystery, which she sought to solve without succeeding. But a few years later &#8230;</p>
<p>In 1989, a handsome middle-aged man came to the cottage and told Sadie that his car had run out of gas, asked if she could lend him some books so he could fill up at the station Very close. The man promised to return later to reimburse him, and to prove his good faith, he proposed to leave his watch, an object of prize, as a pledge. Then, as he looked sincere, Sadie gave him a five-pound note and he was obviously very grateful. The man walked to the petrol station with his can, filled it with gasoline, and then returned to his Ford Fiesta, which was parked in an alley near the cottage. He then went to Sadie&#8217;s house, handed her the change of the five dollar bill she had lent him, And told him that he would immediately go and get the money he still owed him. The young woman tried to dissuade him, but the man seemed to be there because he left without waiting. He returned about six o&#8217;clock in the evening with a five-dollar note and a bouquet of carnations. Flattered by this attention, Sadie accepted the flowers, and he kissed her hand gallantly. He had just turned round, ready to go, when suddenly she exclaimed:</p>
<p>&#8211; Wait! You forget your wristwatch!</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; replied the man, walking up the road.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come and have a cup of tea,&#8221; she said graciously.</p>
<p>Sadie was alone since the death of her husband, and she found the man seductive. They argued for hours. He told her that his name was Tim, that he was from Middlewich, and that he was coming out of a long relationship that had ended badly. His girlfriend, with whom he had been for four years, had suddenly left him for someone else and he had kept a certain mistrust for the opposite sex. The young woman advised her not to shut herself up because of an unfortunate experience, and she discreetly made him understand that she felt lonely. Sadie was almost forty, Tim was twenty-six, but the age gap did not seem so great. They left each other at twenty-one, after exchanging their telephone numbers.</p>
<p>Two days later, Sadie tried to phone Tim, but it appeared that the number he had given her was not assigned and she did not know what to think. She wondered if he had voluntarily given her a false number or if she had simply deceived herself but she hoped that he would call her and see each other again. A few days later, the phone rang in the house. Abigail replied, then ran to her mother, crying, &#8220;Mom, it&#8217;s for you! Sadie, hoping to hear Tim, grabbed the receiver hurriedly and said, &#8220;Hello?&#8221; &#8221;</p>
<p>An old woman then began to talk to her, who told him abominable things about Tim from Middlewich, claiming he was a bigam, that he was a crook and knew that Sadie&#8217;s husband had left him a great deal of money. &#8216;money. The young woman was heartbroken. She asked for her identity, and the old lady answered him to address her owner, who knew her and would give her the answer.</p>
<p>On Sunday night of the following week, Tim made a surprise visit to Sadie. This time he had brought her flowers and a bottle of wine. Troubled by the old lady&#8217;s words, she immediately spoke to him of the anonymous call but even before she had finished telling his story, Tim got up abruptly, then put on his coat and left the house without saying a word word. She never saw him again. A few months later she learned from a neighbor that the young man had an abominable reputation and had spent six months in jail for fraud. He was also known to have two women, one in Crewe, another Chester, and a mistress in Middlewich, with whom he lived.</p>
<p>Soon after, the owner of Sadie visited her for an unimportant question. She took the opportunity to explain that an old lady, who had refused to give her name, had called her to warn her of a certain danger, and began to be nervous. She added that the mysterious stranger had told her he knew her, and he admitted reluctantly that the previous tenants had told her to see the ghost of an old lady. She told them they would have nocturnal phone calls to advise them or prevent them, and he had told himself that they were looking for an excuse to leave without paying their rent. Sadie, who understood his dilemma, reassured him immediately. She did not intend to move. She loved the house and the ghost seemed harmless, not to say benevolent.</p>
<p>Visibly relieved, he told her that five years earlier an old girl named Enid had died at the cottage. She had lived there for twenty years, and she only rarely came out. Rumors had it that she had experienced a grief of love in her youth, and that she had never recovered from it. She loved the little garden behind the house, she spent a lot of time there. One afternoon, his body had been found under the weeping willow. The coroner concluded that he had stroke. A few months later, the new tenants had reported seeing the specter of an elderly woman crossing the back garden on a night in the middle of the night. They had seen her slide over the snow-covered lawn, but when they had gone out, they had found no footprints.</p>
<p>Sadie continued to live in the cottage with her daughter, exactly as she had said. She received no further phone calls from Enid, but every time the phone rang, she expected to hear it. Years later Abigail married, and Sadie, who was still single, found herself alone in the house. Finally alone &#8230; She never really felt alone. She knew that there, somewhere, Enid was still watching over her.</p>
<h2>Dean Koontz</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29470" src="http://www.mindshadow.fr/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/dean-koontz.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 279px) 100vw, 279px" srcset="http://www.mindshadow.fr/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/dean-koontz.jpg 279w, http://www.mindshadow.fr/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/dean-koontz-110x100.jpg 110w, http://www.mindshadow.fr/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/dean-koontz-150x134.jpg 150w" alt="Dean Koontz" width="279" height="250" /></p>
<p>On September 20, 1988, the author of Dean Koontz detective novels had an experience that he refused to speak for more than ten years. That day, he was working in his office when the phone rang. He picked up the receiver and the voice of a woman, who seemed distant to him, said: &#8220;Please, pay attention! Surprised, Dean asked him, &#8220;Who are you?&#8221; But the woman did not answer. She repeated the same warning three times, and on each occasion her voice seemed a little distant.</p>
<p>Suddenly the voice was silent, and Dean sat there listening to the silence for a while. He did not know what to think. The voice resembled that of his mother, who had been dead for almost twenty years. &#8220;It&#8217;s much harder to remember a voice than a face,&#8221; he told himself. &#8220;I have too much imagination. &#8221;</p>
<p>His phone number being on a red list, he knew that no one had been able to play him a trick. Perhaps someone had mistaken the number, quite simply. He told the story to his wife, but to no one else.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a strange call. I do not pretend it was a ghost. I do not know what I think. It was certainly strange. People tell these stories all the time, and it always struck me that everybody seemed to have had one or two strange or disturbing experiences.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think the call was from my mother and sometimes it was a very strange bad number, a happy coincidence. I think you should always keep some skepticism about this kind of stuff, but it is comforting to think that there may be a kingdom where the personality survives. &#8221;</p>
<p>Two days after the phone call, Dean went to visit his father, who was a boarder in a nursing home. He had behavioral problems and the staff had asked his son to come and talk with him. Ray had hit another resident, a man with a walker, and the nurses were worried.</p>
<p>Dean did not know that his father had used part of his small allowance to buy a yellow-handled fishing knife. He had sharpened it so that it would be cut like a razor and he had oiled the hinge so that it could open like a notch.</p>
<p>When Dean entered his room, Ray moved quickly. He grabbed the concealed knife in a drawer, and he ran on to his son. Dean had to struggle to get away from him, and he narrowly escaped the blade of his knife. Many people witnessed this incident, and one of them called the police.</p>
<p>Finally, Dean managed to get the knife back, and he took it to the front desk when the policemen entered the hall. Seeing him with the knife in their hand, they immediately took out their arms and ordered him: &#8220;Throw the knife! Dean, who did not understand, pointed to his father&#8217;s room: &#8220;It&#8217;s not me you are looking for, it&#8217;s there. &#8220;Drop the knife!&#8221; Repeated the policemen, pointing their weapons at him.</p>
<p>Then suddenly he realized that they would shoot him if he did not drop the object. They thought he was the aggressor. Terrified, he quickly opened his hand and let go of the knife, which fell on the floor with a dull thud. He thought he was going to die. Finally, Dean was able to explain and they took his father to a psychiatric cell, where he was kept under observation.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Dean often thought back to the mysterious phone call. He told himself that he had induced him to be more cautious, and that he might have saved his life. He never received another call.</p>
<h2>The Wilson Affair</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29487" src="http://www.mindshadow.fr/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/james-byrne.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 258px) 100vw, 258px" srcset="http://www.mindshadow.fr/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/james-byrne.jpg 258w, http://www.mindshadow.fr/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/james-byrne-150x145.jpg 150w" alt="James Byrne" width="258" height="250" /></p>
<p>In 1995, a medium named James Byrne came every week to answer questions from the listeners of a radio station in Liverpool, England. Mr. Byrne said he was delivering messages from the other world, and he was very popular. He was even asked so much that in each of his passages, the calls would blow up the standard. One day Mrs. Wilson of Ellesmere Port called the radio station to try to talk to the medium. She was desperate. Her grandfather had died a year ago, and she wanted to know if he had a message for her. Unfortunately, the standard was so cluttered that its appeal was not meant to succeed. Then, as she could do nothing else, she sat down in her chair and listened to the show.</p>
<p>About twenty-two o&#8217;clock, at the beginning of the <em>News At Tens program</em> , as every evening, his telephone began to ring. Mrs. Wilson answered the call, and a distant and familiar voice said to her: &#8220;Listen, sweetie, I&#8217;m fine. It&#8217;s wonderful here. I&#8217;m with your grandmother and all the other nice people who are dead. &#8221;</p>
<p>Amazed, Mrs. Wilson, who had recognized her grandfather, murmured: &#8220;Grandfather, is it you? Her legs were so weak that it seemed she was going to fall. &#8220;Yeah, darling. Now listen. You have to stop living in the past and memories. Go ahead. I&#8217;m still there and I look at you. I have to go now love. Tell the children that I love them. Goodbye. &#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Wilson thought for a moment and once the emotion passed, she came to wonder if anyone had not made a joke. She dialed 1471 on her phone to get the last caller&#8217;s number but to her surprise the automated voice gave her her own number. As if she had telephoned herself. Mrs. Wilson, who had no other post in the house, then concluded that her grandfather had somehow called her from beyond to let her know that he was fine.</p>
<h2>The Thing</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29484" src="http://www.mindshadow.fr/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/franck-jones.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 221px) 100vw, 221px" srcset="http://www.mindshadow.fr/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/franck-jones.jpg 221w, http://www.mindshadow.fr/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/franck-jones-133x150.jpg 133w" alt="Franck Jones" width="221" height="250" /></p>
<p>In 1971, Mr. and Mrs. Ross told <em>The Gazette</em> that a malicious spirit, which they had dubbed <em>The Thing</em> , was pulling the covers of the children&#8217;s beds while they were sleeping, smelling stinking odors in their homes And that something was breathing close to their ears.</p>
<p>Twenty years later, Frank Jones, his wife and two children moved into the former Ross family home on Windsor Avenue in Thornton. Frank was more than skeptical about the reality of an evil presence, but he quickly changed his mind. &#8220;I thought they&#8217;d imagined it, but there was a lot of door slamming and a smell of dirt in the house. Then one evening I lay down in my bed, and a fog crossed the room. I wanted to shout something at him, but the words did not come out of my mouth. My face seemed paralyzed. I was completely overwhelmed. &#8221;</p>
<p>According to her daughter, Maureen, who was thirty years old, The Thing enjoyed opening the faucets and sacking the house. &#8220;You think people exaggerate until you experience it. One evening, I was alone at home when suddenly I heard these footsteps on the stairs. They went into my dad&#8217;s room and I heard all the cabinets banging, as if they were open. It sounded like burglars. &#8221;</p>
<p>In 1996 an exorcist of the Spiritualized Church of Fleetwood claimed to have expelled from property a &#8220;spirit trapped between two worlds&#8221; and all phenomena suddenly ceased. The family then had a few peaceful years, until 2003, when Frank experienced a double tragedy. He lost his son, Steven, thirty-two years old, from a brain tumor, and three months later his wife, Sadie, from a heart attack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right after Sadie&#8217;s death, I went back home but I did not want to go home. I saw that I had a missed call on my mobile, but it had not rang and the number was that of my own home. Yet there was no one. Then I went inside, and there was the usual smell of Sadie&#8217;s cigarettes and that of her perfume. &#8221;</p>
<p>Subsequently, Frank and his family began receiving strange SMS messages and they concluded that they were from Sadie. &#8220;She always had a mobile with her. We buried him with his phone and the messages were composed of the words that Sadie used to say, but there was no number. &#8221;</p>

<p>On September 12, 2008, a train crash at San Fermando, California, killed twenty-five people, including Charles Peck, a forty-nine-year-old man. He died on impact, but his body was not immediately found. During the following hours, his family received thirty-five calls from his cell phone. No one ever heard anything other than static electricity, but thinking that he was still alive, every time his fiancée was called, she shouted messages of encouragement: &#8220;Hang baby! &#8220;We&#8217;ll get you out of here!&#8221; &#8221; &#8221; Everything will be alright ! &#8220;Etc. When they tried to reach him, they immediately fell on the voicemail, as if the phone was already on the phone.</p>
<p>The authorities succeeded in drawing one of these telephone calls, which led them to the first wagon, where Charles Peck&#8217;s body was. According to the rescuers, there was no sign that he survived the accident, even for a short time. His phone kept calling his family for an hour, then he stopped for good. Some argued that his laptop had a technical failure and that he had dialed numbers from his address book at random, but in a strange way, only his family members, his son, his brother, his sister , His mother-in-law and his fiancee had been called.</p>
