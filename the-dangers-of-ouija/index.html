<p>Many people, who wonder about the dangers of Ouija, write to me regularly to ask for advice. So, rather than giving my opinion, which has only relative value, I decided to gather the opinions of specialists of the paranormal, religious, scientists and testimonies of some participants. Thus, everyone can get an idea on the issue and decide, knowingly, whether to use a Ouija board</p>
<h2>The Opinion of the Experts of the Paranormal</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-29337 size-full" title="Manly P. Hall" src="http://www.mindshadow.fr/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/manly-p-hall.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 288px) 100vw, 288px" srcset="http://www.mindshadow.fr/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/manly-p-hall.jpg 288w, http://www.mindshadow.fr/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/manly-p-hall-144x150.jpg 144w" alt="Manly P. Hall" width="288" height="300" /></p>
<p>Most paranormal investigators and mediums affirm that Ouija only has a name for it, that it opens a portal to evil spirits and demons, and that it can have serious consequences.</p>
<p>In 1944, the occultist Manly P. Hall, the founder of the Philosophical Research Society, declared in <em>Horizon</em> magazine : &#8220;In the last 20-25 years I have met a considerable number of people who have complicated their lives Playing with a Ouija board. Out of a hundred cases, at least ninety-five had disastrous consequences. I have seen broken homes, alienated families, and even suicides that can be attributed directly to this cause. &#8221;</p>
<p>Stocker Hunt, who had researched the effects of using a Ouija board, believed that victims often came into contact with spirits of the astral bottom. &#8220;The invader focuses on the character weaknesses of his victims. If one is vain, then calls to vanity will be made. &#8220;I need help,&#8221; said the invader, &#8220;You alone can help me.&#8221; The malevolent entity does not hesitate to lie, to change one&#8217;s identity, usually taking that of a deceased loved one, and she is flattering. It is preferable for the invader that his victim be alone, isolated and ill. If need be, it will frighten him by materializing in a horrible form, inducing grotesque visions, producing a poltergeist activity, materializing objects, Giving false or tragic news, and levitating objects or even his victim. All these things and more can be produced, not as ends in them, but as a means for complete eventual possession. &#8221;</p>
<p>In 1971, in his autobiography, medium Susy Smith issued this warning: &#8220;We must tell people to stay away from Ouija and automatic writing. I have experienced many and terrible problems with such practices. If I had been warned that I was at risk of mental disorders, I would probably be more cautious. &#8221;</p>
<p>In 1976, Martin Ebon explained in his book <em>The Satan Trap: Dangers of the Occult</em>  : &#8220;Everything can start innocently enough, perhaps with a Ouija board, which will begin to bring information to establish some credibility or pretend to be A deceased. It is common that people have allegedly chosen to perform a special task.</p>
<p>Then often, Ouija becomes vulgar, aggressive or threatening. Its demands increase and become hostile. Participants can use the board compulsively, as if they were possessed by a spirit, or hear voices that control or command them. &#8221;</p>
<p>In 1987, Phil Phillips and Joan Hake Robie wrote in their book, <em>Halloween and Satanism</em> : &#8220;The Ouija board is NOT a game for a pajama party. It is a deadly, serious and occult instrument. Nevertheless, there are people for whom the Ouija board is like a religion. They consult her to ask her to guide them, and they live according to what she tells them. This is extremely dangerous and can lead to destruction. &#8221;</p>
<p>The American demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren said they understood the mediums who used Ouija knowingly, but they considered the game &#8220;as dangerous as drugs&#8221; for all amateurs. They asserted that during the Ouija sessions, evil spirits were often considered dead relatives to better control the lives of their victims. Ed even called the board a &#8220;famous passe-partout for terror.&#8221; &#8221;</p>
<p>John Zaffis, the famous paranormal investigator, said the most serious cases of harassment and demonic possession occurred after a Ouija session.</p>
<p>Ralph Sarchie, the famous policeman and demonologist who inspired the film <em>Deliver Us from Evil</em>, said that he had studied cases of witchcraft, Satanism, and that he had attended a dozen exorcisms but that Ouija Remained one of the greatest dangers of occultism. &#8220;There should be a law against these bad occult toys,&#8221; he wrote in his book <em>Beware the Night</em> . &#8220;I can hear some of you saying&#8221; Hey, I used a Ouija board, and nothing happened. &#8220;Consider yourself lucky then. It&#8217;s like playing Russian roulette. When you put the gun on your head, if you do not hear a loud sound, then it&#8217;s good. It is the same for Ouija. The more you pull the trigger, the more likely it is that at the next move, Your world will darken. &#8221;</p>
<p>Millions of Ouija have been sold around the world, which would be responsible for marriages, divorce, illness, misery, paranormal phenomena or murder. The medium Ann Rose commented on these stories as follows: &#8220;Horrible demons have most certainly been freed by the Ouija board. In an interview with the <em>Sun</em> , Mrs. Rose, who lived in Merriville, Indiana, warned readers of the newspaper, saying that evil spirits or demonic forces often gained the confidence of people experiencing Ouija in Responding honestly to several of their questions and offering them predictions. &#8220;Once they have gained the confidence of their victims, it is easy for the entity to take over the person either by strongly influencing it, Or by possessing it purely and simply. &#8221;</p>
<p>According to the ghost hunter Dale Kaczmarek of the Ghost Researtch Society: &#8220;Ouija is not dangerous in itself, but your way of communicating is often dangerous. Most of the time, the spirits contacted by the Ouija are those who reside on the lower astral plane. These minds are often very confused. They may have had a violent or sudden death, they were murdered, they committed suicide etc. Therefore, many violent, negative and potentially dangerous conditions are present for those who use the Ouija board.</p>
<p>Often, many minds try to come at the same time, but the real danger lies when you ask them for a physical proof of their existence! You might say, &#8220;Well, if you really are a spirit, can you put out that light or move that object? What you have just done is simple, you have opened a door. You have allowed them to enter the physical world and problems are to be expected. &#8221;</p>
<p>For the past few years, the sale of Ouija boards has been steadily increasing and Darren Ansell, a paranormal investigator, has expressed concern about this issue. &#8220;I will not advise anyone to use a Ouija board. The few times I tried to try, I had many fears. &#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Peter Moscou, President of the Psychotronics Association in the United States, said the dangers of Ouija were real: &#8220;Unfortunately, there are many negative experiences with Ouija. I really can not recommend its use. In my experience, there are too many negative experiences, and sometimes very serious negative experiences, as a result of the opening up of areas of reality that people are not ready to manage. &#8221;</p>
<p>The medium Anna Foster explained the Ouija thus: &#8220;Imagine, if you will, that the Ouija board is a dimensional door. When you use the board you open it, as a receiving station, and you can get something positive or very negative. People often discover, from the moment they experience real negative phenomena with the Ouija, what we call the lower spirits. These are people who have not migrated to their next level of life. &#8221;</p>
<p>In his book <em>Your Powers Sprituels</em> Laura Tuan, who presents himself as an expert in astrology, parapsychology and esotericism, describes some methods and theories related to the paranormal. She dedicates a few pages to the Ouija, touting her merits and presenting it as an excellent means of communicating with spirits, but also with living beings. She ended by saying that we should not believe all the negative testimonies on the Ouija, which is absolutely not dangerous.</p>
<h2>The Scientific Opinion</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-29339 size-full" title="Sir William Barrett" src="http://www.mindshadow.fr/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/sir-william-barrett.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 246px) 100vw, 246px" srcset="http://www.mindshadow.fr/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/sir-william-barrett.jpg 246w, http://www.mindshadow.fr/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/sir-william-barrett-123x150.jpg 123w" alt="Sir William Barrett" width="246" height="300" /></p>
<p>In general, scientists do not believe in spirits, demons and all these things, and they do not consider Ouija as a dangerous game. They accuse participants of unconsciously moving the clipboard, cheating or being naive. However, some psychiatrists advise against the practice of Ouija, underlining the disturbing psychological repercussions observed among the most fragile.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the nineteenth century, Sir William Barrett, an English physicist and parapsychologist, declared that the intelligence displayed in certain sittings of Ouija went well beyond the usual human faculties.</p>
<p>In 1924, Dr. Carl Wickland, an American psychiatrist, wrote a book on mental illness, warning users of Ouija boards: &#8220;The serious problem of alienation and insanity after attending mundane Psychic experiences has been brought to my attention. I have thus been able to observe the cases of several persons whose innocuous activities, such as automatic writing or the Ouija board, have led them into such wild madness that it has been necessary to lock them up in asylum. Many other disastrous consequences of the use of a Ouija board, a so-called innocent object, have been reported to me, and my observations have led me to seek in psychic phenomena a possible explanation for these strange events. &#8221;</p>
<p>In 1995, former Director of the New Jersey Psychiatric Asylum, Dr. Curry, declared that the Ouija board was a dangerous object that could cause mental imbalance and that if its popularity persisted, then the asylums would be filled with people, Having used.</p>
<p>According to scientific experiments conducted in 2014 by physicist Michael Faraday, chemist Eugene Chevreul and psychologists William James and Ray Hyman, many phenomena attributed to paranormal forces were due to an ideomotor effect. The participants, even if they are sincere, would move the board without even realizing it, by small unconscious muscular movements, in order to obtain a response in accordance with their expectations.</p>
<p>James Randhi, illusionist and skeptical, adheres to the theory of the ideomotor effect. In an experiment he found that when the participants in a Ouija session were blindfolded, then the messages delivered by the so-called spirits no longer made any sense. He then concluded that the movements of the planchette were due to the unconscious muscular thrusts of the participants and that all the other manifestations observed, the poltergeist phenomena, the revelations, the smells of decaying flesh, the Ouija plates refusing to burn, Was that legend. One day, when he spoke of the stories surrounding Ouija with one of his skeptical friends, he offered to pass on the message: &#8220;Ask everyone to go and buy a Ouija board and set it on fire. If it does not burn, They will earn a million dollars. &#8221;</p>
<p>Recently, a British university used a Ouija board in hopes of advancing knowledge about unconscious cognition. According to Hélène Gauchou, a member of the research team: &#8220;We can consciously believe that we do not know an answer, but in fact we have it somewhere in our subconscious. Maybe we heard it on the radio without paying attention to it. &#8221;</p>
<p>The experiment took place in two stages. The team first asked the participants concrete questions, who responded according to their level of knowledge, then asked the same questions using a Ouija board and some who said they did not know the answers first Times, have just answered. They were blindfolded, alone in front of the Ouija board, but the rate of correct answers rose from 50 to 65%. The researchers concluded that men possessed another intelligent, unconscious and accessible under certain conditions, and that Ouija did not allow to communicate with the spirits, but with a buried part of our brain.</p>
<p>According to Father Dominic Walker, psychologist and counselor in exorcism, the Ouija practice would not allow communication with the dead, but it would exert a dangerous influence on the minds of the participants.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Alberto Gonzalez of the Pan American Health Institute, terrifying demons, freed from other dimensions, attack defenseless men through Ouija boards. &#8220;They are vile creatures of the night,&#8221; explained Dr. Gonzalez. &#8220;They exist. They can possess the bodies of their victims and push calm and non-violent people to commit abominable crimes. They can take other forms, some quite horrible.</p>
<p>And they are among us, in many cases, solely because of these sinister toys called Ouija. &#8220;Dr. Gonzalez, a psychiatrist and parapsychologist, also claimed to have found evidence that demons were involved in several cases of female genital mutilation and vampirism in South America.</p>
<p>Dr. Marta Prohazka of Fairfax, Virginia, is convinced that spirits can play destructive and terrifying games with humans. &#8220;The use of Ouija has already led to violence and even assassination &#8230;&#8221; During her career as a psychotherapist and psychoanalyst, she realized that many patients, whom she had initially considered Hallucinating paranoid schizophrenics, could simply be in contact with something invisible to her, but visible to them. &#8220;I came to understand that another plan, or another dimension or existence, was interacting with our world,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;Through the formation and expansion of consciousness, some individuals acquire an entrance into this invisible dimension. For some people,</p>
<p>I also learned that contact with the other dimension could be dangerous, especially if a psychologically sensitive person loses emotional harmony. The window on the sky can then become a window on hell. &#8221;</p>
<h2>Reviews of Christians</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-29047 size-medium" title="Malaqui Martin" src="http://www.mindshadow.fr/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/malachi-martin-300x300.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" srcset="http://www.mindshadow.fr/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/malachi-martin-300x300.jpg 300w, http://www.mindshadow.fr/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/malachi-martin-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.mindshadow.fr/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/malachi-martin.jpg 360w" alt="Malaqui Martin" width="300" height="300" /></p>
<p>Christians regard the Ouija as the instrument of the devil. The Bible does not speak of Ouija, but it warns against spiritism and, more generally, against all occult practices.</p>
<ul>
<li>Leviticus 19:31: &#8220;Do not speak to those who evoke spirits, nor to soothsayers; Do not consult them, not to be defiled by them. I am Yahweh your God. &#8220;</li>
<li>Deuteronomy 18: 10-12: &#8220;Let no one be found in you who causes his son or daughter to pass through the fire, who engages in divination, auguries, superstitions and enchantments, , Who consults evocators and sorcerers, and who questions the dead. For every man that doeth these things is an abomination to Yahweh, and it is because of these abominations that Yahweh your God will drive these nations out before you. &#8220;</li>
<li>Isaiah 8:19: &#8220;When they say to you,&#8221; See those who call to mind the dead, and the soothsayers who murmur and whisper, &#8220;reply,&#8221; Shall not a people consult their God? Will he consult the dead for the living? &#8220;</li>
</ul>
<p>For the religious authorities, to use a Ouija board, even innocently, opens a portal to demons that &#8220;then invade the heart and the mind&#8221; of those who have unintentionally attracted them. The dead are never manifested through the Ouija, only the evil spirits who pretend to be dead.</p>
<p>J. Godfrey Raupert was an investigator of the paranormal and hoped to prove scientifically spiritualism but he converted to Catholicism and renounced his project. In the late 1910s Ouija became such a concern for the Church that Pope Pius X asked Raupert to warn the faithful of the dangers of his use. In 1919 he published a book on the subject, <em>The New Black Magic and the Truth on the Ouija Board</em> , explaining that the spirits contacted were often Machiavellian, that they ridiculed Christianity and fanned the lowest instincts of the participants. &#8220;By this means it is easy to open a mental door through which the mind can be invaded and it is very difficult, if not impossible, To close this door to expel the invader. &#8221;</p>
<p>Fr. Thomas Euteneurer, exorcist and author of <em>Exorcism and the </em><em>Militant Church</em> , claimed that ninety percent of possession cases had started with a Ouija board.</p>
<p>Father Malachi Martin, a Jesuit who wrote many books on demonic possession, explained that the individual did not even need to engage with the demoniac intentionally to find himself possessed, but that it was enough for him to bubble In the occult, play with a Ouija board or just attend a session.</p>
<p>For the Catholic apologist Joel S. Peters, Ouija is a very dangerous game. &#8220;The Ouija board is far from being harmless, because it is a form of divination. In reality, the Ouija board does not really work, and the only spirits contacted through it are evil. That someone considers Ouija as harmless does not mean that it really is.</p>
<p>Disbelief for something does not necessarily mean that something is not real. The Ouija board has an objective reality that exists outside the perception of the object. In other words, it&#8217;s real, even if you do not believe in it. &#8221;</p>
<p>According to Father John Zühlsdorf: &#8220;Avoid, avoid, avoid these things that might open you up to oppression for the enemy, such as Tarot cards, Ouija, and other things that might be taken for&#8221; games. If you possess such things, destroy them now, not later. &#8221;</p>
<p>For Reverend Morris Cerullo, author of <em>The Black Side Of Satan </em> : &#8220;Many people have told me strange stories about answers given by a Ouija board. Ouija and other occult games may seem intriguing, but the consequences are serious and should not be approached. They can lead to dangerous waters in truth. &#8221;</p>
<p>In 2010, Father Luc Beaudoin, of the parish of Saint-Antoine-de-Lavaltrie, Quebec, had been a priest for four years and had already practiced a dozen exorcisms. He said: &#8220;Some houses where I went are sometimes places where spiritual sessions or black masses were celebrated. We must take these things very seriously. We do not play with this kind of practice. Ouija, we should not take this lightly. &#8221;</p>
<p>In 2015, Fr. José María Muñoz Urbano, the official exorcist of the diocese of Cordoba, was interviewed on the radio and said that the exorcism was still in great demand, even more and more, and that the possessions or infestations Often the consequence of Ouija&#8217;s session. &#8220;70% of cases of possessions or people infected by the demon that I meet are because of Ouija sessions,&#8221; explained the priest. &#8220;We want to try to talk with a dead man &#8230; We play and then strange things happen in the house where people suddenly begin to feel bad or some things do not work anymore. When we call the demon, it comes and then we have to pay the price. &#8221;</p>
<p>Father Vincent Lampert, an American exorcist priest, also found that demands for exorcism were becoming more and more frequent. In the United States, the number of exorcists has increased from twelve to fifty in ten years. The phenomenon is the same in the United Kingdom and other European countries, and largely due to activities &#8220;bringing the Devil,&#8221; such as the use of a Ouija board to dialogue with the dead.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is easy to invoke evil spirits with this board, but it is very difficult to get rid of it,&#8221; said a priest on condition of anonymity. &#8220;People can sometimes be very naive when they think they are in contact with the spirits of their loved ones. &#8221;</p>

<p>Many Ouija boards have been sold around the world, and the testimonies are legion, both in the newspapers and on the Internet. Most users report having had a negative experience, and even terrifying at times, but some, much more rare, say they are satisfied with their sessions and feel ready to start over.</p>
<h3>The Ouija Hex</h3>
<p>( <em>National Examiner</em> of 17-03-1997)</p>
<p>I invited the horror into my house with a Ouija board. My brother and I had no results when we started using the psychic apparatus, then the message indicator suddenly and mysteriously began to move. The first thing Ouija told us is that the message was sent by Seth. I then made the tragic mistake of asking us to prove that it was real by doing something supernatural. The results were frightening and surprising. The council told us that the grandfather of one of my best friends was going to die in the week. The chandelier in the room began to shake violently and the chime sounded as if pieces of metal had banged together.</p>
<p>Suddenly all the noises ceased and the room became as silent as a cemetery in the middle of the night. My brother and I looked at each other, terrified. We opened all the windows to get rid of the decaying smell of flesh and we thought we would forget everything but a week later my friend&#8217;s grandfather died just as the board had Predicted! From time to time the chandelier made a back and forth movement, the room became icy and the terrible odor came back. I could not bear any more. I threw the Ouija and told the experience to my mother. She told me that once you&#8217;ve been rubbing with a Ouija board, her spell remains forever. Nowadays,</p>
<h3>Join Me in Hell</h3>
<p>(Tony&#8217;s testimony)</p>
<p>The night of terror began with a few drinks, one evening in July 2011. &#8220;It was just another night out with our group of friends,&#8221; explained Toni. &#8220;We all drank and decided to go to a friend&#8217;s house called Brittny. &#8221;</p>
<p>The idea of ​​using a Ouija board was floating in Toni&#8217;s mind for three days and when her friends sat down in Brittny&#8217;s house, she immediately offered to have a session. &#8220;I wanted to play with a Ouija board just for fun. As we had all drunk and my elder brother knew how to make a Ouija board home, we all thought it was a good idea. &#8221;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they were cruelly mistaken. After reciting an opening prayer, the friends began their Ouija session. &#8220;We put my hands and my brother on the triangle we had cut and used as a planchette. We had it heated by rotating it in a circle for about forty seconds. &#8221;</p>
<p>They then stopped, and Toni&#8217;s brother asked the first question.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there a spirit with us now?&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment, nothing happened and then Toni&#8217;s friend Taylor made a sarcastic remark and the plank slipped to the Yes in the top corner of the board.</p>
<p>&#8220;At first, I really thought it was my older brother who made her move,&#8221; Toni said. But I was wrong. &#8221;</p>
<p>Toni, his brother and his friends played with the board in turn, and the messages became more and more dark.</p>
<p>&#8220;We changed people about eight times when we started to be afraid. Between all of us, we had allowed nine spirits to enter the room. &#8221;</p>
<p>Ouija told them that the minds of six women and three men were in the same room as they did, and they started asking them questions like, &#8220;Is one of you &#8216; Is committed suicide? &#8221;</p>
<p>Apparently, some had. &#8220;Ouija wrote the word&#8221; three. We then asked them how, proposing to them to designate the letter B Ball, P for hanged etc &#8230; »</p>
<p>At first, the plank slipped to the X, then it went to the P, and something happened that terrified them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We heard a soft knock, as if someone was rocking at the end of a rope and his feet regularly hit the wall. We asked the mind what was this noise and why he had killed himself, and he stated &#8220;woman.&#8221; »»</p>
<p>&#8211; Your wife was murdered?</p>
<p>&#8211; No.</p>
<p>&#8211; How she died ?</p>
<p>&#8211; Devil.</p>
<p>&#8220;We asked her if the devil had pushed her to do it, and the triangle went on Yes. We then inquired whether he hated women, and he answered each one of them. »»</p>
<p>A heavy silence fell on the room, which was only broken by the dull sound of their breaths and their occasional questions. The board moved quickly, sliding without hesitation on the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;We asked him if he wanted to harm one of the girls in the room, and the triangle said yes. We asked him how, and he spelled fire. »»</p>
<p>Then suddenly, the board began to move quickly from letter to letter and she repeatedly spelled the word &#8220;mutilate.&#8221; &#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then one of the candles we had lit fell on the floor and the hot wax splashed my leg. Or at least it seemed to me that it was hot wax. It finally turned out that it was a pretty deep cut. I do not know who made it to me. &#8221;</p>
<p>Despite this incident, the meeting continued. &#8220;Some started to have fun. When asked, the Ouija board identified each of the people present. &#8221;</p>
<p>The last to use Ouija were the brother of Toni and Brittny. The two boys came face to face, and they began to ask questions. &#8220;I was not afraid until the last session. This time we were dealing with a demonic spirit, an angry demonic spirit. &#8221;</p>
<p>Toni&#8217;s brother asked, &#8220;Are you good or bad?&#8221; Ouija replied that he was evil. &#8220;We all laughed, and my brother asked several questions. &#8221;</p>
<p>Taylor then shouted, &#8220;We should put it away and stop messing around with it. But the group was focused on the board, and everyone ignored it. &#8220;We asked the demonic spirit if he wanted to hurt someone in the room, and the board spelled&#8221; hat. &#8221; But Taylor was the only one wearing a hat. My brother asked him to point the triangle to the one he wanted to hurt, and he went straight to Taylor. &#8221;</p>
<p>The young man jumped out of his seat swearing and then went to sit in another part of the room, away from Ouija. The point of the planchette followed him and she wrote that he was cursed. &#8220;We asked more questions, but most of the answers were too confusing for us to understand. Others, on the other hand, were very clear.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Ouija board spelled out my father&#8217;s name and I almost got a heart attack because my dad is really a first bastard. &#8221;</p>
<p>Toni&#8217;s brother asked him why he was interested in their father, and the board started to move again. &#8220;He slowly wrote&#8221; agreement with the devil. My brother asked him to be more specific, and he replied &#8220;no work.&#8221; &#8220;Indeed, their father did not work. He was invalid, he was receiving a government pension and his medicines were free. The board began to spin, stopping briefly on certain letters.</p>
<p>JOINMEINHELLPAD (Join me in Hell Pad)</p>
<p>&#8220;My brother knocked down the Ouija board before he finished writing our name. &#8221;</p>
<p>Toni&#8217;s brother and Brittny took the Ouija board and destroyed it, just like the leaves they used to write the messages of the spirits. Then they burned the pieces.</p>
<p>&#8220;After that night, I never touched a Ouija board again. I now know it&#8217;s not a game. &#8221;</p>
<h3>A Ouija Summons A Demon</h3>
<p>( <em>The Sun</em> , 09-12-1986)</p>
<p>A simple Ouija board became a passport to hell for a family who accidentally invited a demon into their living room. &#8220;I thought it could be the devil himself,&#8221; said John Ravens, the father of the tormented family. &#8220;When it was over, we were all bleeding and we had serious traces of burns. Our living room was a disaster area. &#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was supposed to be a joke,&#8221; said his wife Gloria. We wanted to make believe that we were talking with the spirit world. &#8221;</p>
<p>Young Lynda, her nine-year-old brother, Ronald, and their parents had gathered around a Ouija board for what they thought was a pleasant evening in their home on the outskirts of Toronto, Canada. &#8220;We were just playing with all of a sudden, the board that gives the answers started to move by itself,&#8221; John explained. &#8220;We were all scared, but I thought maybe one of the kids was joking us. We started asking questions, and that spirit started talking to us. Then he asked if he could come and see us. At the time, I was sure someone was playing a trick, and I said yes. &#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s when the nightmare really started. &#8220;The demon appeared in a few seconds. He walked around the room laughing and cursing us all. It was surrounded by a ring of fire and the room became so hot it looked like a brazier of hell. The family described the demon as a red and black creature with scales on the skin, horns and large bat wings. &#8220;Then he suddenly fell on us and he attacked us. He began by biting each of us in the face and arms. We tried to get up and run to the door, but whenever we did, the creature scratched us. It was so fast that we could not escape. &#8221;</p>
<p>Lynda and her brother were caught repeatedly and thrown across the room. When they fell helplessly on the ground, the demon leapt upon their breasts and heads. &#8220;He had clogs that left traces on my children&#8217;s faces and skin, scarred them cruelly,&#8221; added Gloria. The attack lasted more than an hour before the demon disappeared as quickly as it had appeared. John then took out the children, who screamed and cried, from the house and took them to a nearby hospital, where they were treated for cuts and burns.</p>

<h3>Positive Experience with Ouija</h3>
<p>(Testimony Anonymous)</p>
<p>In June 2002, I lost my sister in dramatic circumstances. She was seven months pregnant and had a stroke following an aneurysm. She and the baby died. She was only twenty-two and needless to tell you that shook the family. She died during her baby shower, and it was really weird.</p>
<p>A few years later my mother came to see me and she confessed that from time to time she would play with a Ouija board with some friends and talk to my sister Emma. At first I thought she was crazy and I told her she was stupid. Eventually, she managed to convince me to sit down to take part in a session with her and her friends. They started asking commonplace questions, such as &#8220;Is someone here?&#8221; Then it became more personal.</p>
<p>My sister told us she was there and then she told us things that only my mother and I knew. She seemed very, very real. I was never afraid, I felt almost at peace.</p>
<p>Little things happened. Sometimes my mother smelled a pat on her shoulder and the Ouija said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got it! On other occasions, the telephone rang and the Ouija asked us, &#8220;Why are not you going to answer?&#8221; &#8221;</p>
<p>I had always been told not to get close to Ouija boards, to invite evil into your life, among other things, but I have tried many times, and I have never had a bad experience.</p>
<h3>Good experience with Ouija</h3>
<p>(Testimony Anonymous)</p>
<p>True story. Several years ago when I was a teenager, I was seventy-three years ago, and I was in the forces stationed in Gilbratar. One day, one of the girls, whom I will call Joan, wanted to try a Ouija board and she made one with cut letters and a simple glass. Another girl and I refused to attend, but we sat down and watched from a distance. His questions were of the kind that young girls like to ask &#8220;Will I get married? &#8220;How many children will I have?&#8221; Each time, the glass began to move and he answered his questions.</p>
<p>At one point, the other girl, whom I will call her Fay, accused Joan of moving the glass, telling her that it was easy to cheat because all the answers were about future events, which could not be verified . Joan asked me to ask a question I knew the answer but that no one else knew. I ended up asking him my father&#8217;s first name, which is usually used as a surname.</p>
<p>At first, the glass remained motionless then it began to move and slowly, he spelled correctly his first name. He then wrote my name and a message. He told me that I was loved and that I should not be afraid because I was protected. At that moment, Joan had her finger on the glass and she looked frightened.</p>
<p>As the glass uttered the last word, suddenly he fled from under his finger, he crossed the table and he smashed on the floor. Needless to say, she never wanted to try again.</p>
<p>At the time, my father was alive and well, but I had no contact with him since the divorce of my parents. All I know is that regardless of the difficulties in my life, something or someone has always managed to fix them at best. Is it a coincidence or does someone or something watch over me? I would not know how to say it. I never retouched a Ouija board.</p>
